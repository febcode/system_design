# What Is a Webhook?

A webhook is like someone knocking on your door to deliver a message as soon as something happens.

Example:

Let’s say you have an app that integrates with Slack.

A user sends a message in a Slack channel.

Slack instantly calls your API (https://yourapp.com/webhook) with the message data.

That call is the webhook.


Key Points:

Webhooks are HTTP POST requests.

They are event-driven: only triggered when something happens.

Your system must have a public API endpoint to receive them.

'''
Sample Payload (from Slack or Stripe):

{
  "event": "message.posted",
  "data": {
    "text": "Hello!",
    "user": "U123456"
  }
}

Simple Flask Receiver:

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    print("Received:", data)
    return '', 200
'''

# 2. What Is a Process Queue?

A queue helps you do work later or in the background, especially when:

The work is slow (e.g., sending email, saving big data)

You don’t want to block the main request (like a webhook)


Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine a restaurant. Orders come in (webhooks), and they’re added to a queue in the kitchen. Cooks (workers) process the orders one by one.

Why Use a Queue with Webhooks?

Webhooks must respond quickly (within seconds).
If you process everything in the webhook itself (e.g., calling an API, writing to DB), it can timeout or fail.

Instead:

Accept the webhook

Push the data into a queue (like Redis, RabbitMQ, or a simple database table)

A background worker picks it up and processes it

Python Example Using Redis + RQ

Install:

pip install redis rq flask

Webhook (Pusher):

from flask import Flask, request
from rq import Queue
from redis import Redis
from worker import process_data  # this is your job function

app = Flask(__name__)
redis_conn = Redis()
queue = Queue(connection=redis_conn)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    queue.enqueue(process_data, data)  # push job to queue
    return 'OK', 200

Worker (process_data job):

def process_data(data):
    # do something slow like DB write or API call
    print("Processing:", data)

Run the worker:

rq worker

Summary

Concept	Think Of It Like...	Key Benefit

Webhook	A doorbell that notifies you	Instant trigger from another service
Queue	A waiting line for background jobs	No delays, retry, scale better
Worker	A background chef	Processes tasks one by one or in parallel
