stateful and stateless systems differ in how they manage user sessions and data persistence.
- Stateful systems retain information about previous interactions, while stateless systems treat each request as independent. This affects scalability, performance, and ease of development. 

# Stateful Systems:
Definition:
Maintain information about the user's session on the server between requests. 

## Advantages:
- Personalized Experiences: Can provide more personalized experiences by remembering user preferences and past interactions. 
- Improved Performance: Can improve performance by retrieving data only once and reusing it for subsequent requests. 

## Disadvantages:
- Scalability Challenges: Can be harder to scale horizontally, as each request needs to be directed to the server that has the user's session. 
- Higher Resource Consumption: Require more storage to maintain user session data. 
Increased Complexity: More complex to manage and maintain. 

# Stateless Systems:
Definition:
Treat each request as independent, without maintaining any information about previous interactions on the server. 
## Advantages:
- High Scalability: Easily scaled horizontally by distributing requests across multiple servers. 
- Fault Tolerance: More resilient to failures because each server can handle requests independently. 
Simpler Deployment: Easier to deploy and manage. 
- Faster Transactions: Each request can be processed independently, leading to faster transaction times. 
## Disadvantages:
- Less Personalized: Can't provide as personalized experiences as stateful systems. 
- Potential Performance Overhead: May have performance overhead if each request needs to retrieve the same data from a database.

Examples:
Stateful: A shopping cart that remembers items added by a user across multiple pages of a website. 

Stateless: A simple web page that displays content based on a user's search query.
