# Single Sign-On (SSO)
 Allows users to log in once with a single set of credentials and access multiple applications and systems during the same session, without needing to log in repeatedly. It simplifies user authentication and management by centralizing access control. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
How it works:

- Centralized Authentication:
Instead of managing separate logins for each application, SSO uses a central identity provider (IdP) to handle authentication. 
- User Login:
The user logs in once with their credentials to the IdP. 
- Access to Multiple Systems:
After successful login, the user can access multiple applications and systems without needing to re-enter their credentials. 
- Session Management:
The IdP manages the user's session and ensures they remain authenticated across different applications. 

# Benefits of SSO:
- Improved User Experience:
SSO reduces password fatigue and makes it easier for users to access multiple applications, according to Fortinet. 
- Enhanced Security:
SSO can help prevent the reuse of weak or compromised passwords. 
- Centralized Control:
SSO allows for centralized management of user access and authentication, making it easier to enforce security policies. 
- Reduced Costs:
SSO can reduce costs associated with managing multiple user accounts and passwords. 
- Compliance:
SSO can help organizations meet regulatory requirements for authentication and access control. 

Examples of SSO:
Logging into Google services like Gmail and YouTube with the same Google account. 
Using a company's internal SSO system to access various applications and software. 
Using third-party identity providers like Google, Microsoft, or Okta to authenticate users in various applications.
